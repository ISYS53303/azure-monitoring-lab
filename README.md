# Azure Monitoring Lab

This repository provides code for an in-class lab that simulates monitoring and analyzing an Azure Function's response to various incoming requests.

`student-client`: This directory contains the code for a client application that sends multiple requests to the Azure Function.

`server`: This directory houses the "backend" code for the Azure Function itself. It implements the logic for calculating a Fibonacci sequence, simulating workload for the function.

By running this lab, you can gain practical experience with:

- Monitoring Azure Functions
- Analyzing function response times under varying workloads
- Simulating real-world scenarios with multiple requests
